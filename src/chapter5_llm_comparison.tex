\chapter{Comparative Analysis of Different LLMs}
\label{chap:llm_comparison}

The choice of the Large Language Model is a critical factor in the performance of a RAG system.

\section{Performance Evaluation based on Model and Context Window Size}
This section will discuss how different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama series, etc.) perform in a RAG setup. The impact of their context window size on handling retrieved information will also be analyzed. Different models may have varying strengths in synthesizing information, adhering to context, and avoiding hallucinations.
