\chapter{Comparative Analysis of Different LLMs}
\label{chap:llm_comparison}

The Large Language Model serves as the generative component of the RAG system, responsible for synthesizing the retrieved information and generating the final response. The choice of the generator LLM is a critical decision that significantly impacts the system's overall performance, cost, and speed. This chapter provides a comparative analysis of different LLMs in the context of RAG, focusing on how their architectural differences, context window sizes, and inherent capabilities affect their suitability for the generation task.

\section{The Role of the Generator LLM}
In a RAG pipeline, the LLM's role is not to recall facts from its internal parametric memory but to reason over the provided context. As highlighted by Gao et al. (2024) \autocite{gao2024retrievalaugmented}, the ideal generator LLM should excel at:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context Adherence (Faithfulness):} Strictly basing its answer on the provided context and avoiding the introduction of outside information.
    \item \textbf{Information Synthesis:} Weaving together facts from multiple retrieved chunks into a single, coherent answer.
    \item \textbf{Instruction Following:} Accurately following the instructions in the prompt, such as adhering to a specific output format or persona.
    \item \textbf{Noise Resistance:} Ignoring irrelevant or contradictory information within the context and focusing on the most relevant facts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Evaluation based on Model and Context Window Size}
Different LLMs exhibit varying levels of proficiency in these areas. The performance of a RAG system is therefore highly dependent on the specific model chosen for the generation step. This section evaluates various models based on these criteria.

\subsection{Comparing LLM Families}
We can categorize LLMs into several families, each with its own characteristics. Our experiments evaluated models from the following prominent families:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Series (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o):} Developed by OpenAI, these models are known for their strong reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. GPT-4, in particular, has shown a high degree of faithfulness and an ability to synthesize complex information, making it a popular choice for high-quality RAG systems \autocite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport}.
    \item \textbf{Llama Series (e.g., Llama 2, Llama 3):} Developed by Meta, these are powerful open-source models that have become highly competitive with their proprietary counterparts. They offer a strong balance of performance and customizability, allowing for fine-tuning on specific domains. While not evaluated in our final experiments, the Llama series represents a critical open-source alternative and a benchmark for performance in the field \autocite{touvron2023llama}.
    \item \textbf{Claude Series (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet, Opus):} Developed by Anthropic, these models are particularly noted for their large context windows and strong performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning and a deep understanding of long documents \\cite{anthropic2024claude3}.
    \item \textbf{Gemini Series (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro):} Developed by Google, the Gemini models are inherently multimodal and designed for high performance across a wide range of tasks. They have demonstrated strong results in both retrieval and generation, making them a versatile choice for RAG systems \autocite{gemini2023}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Impact of Context Window Size}
The \textbf{context window size} of an LLM defines the maximum amount of text (prompt + retrieved context + generated response) that the model can handle at one time. This has several implications for RAG, as discussed by Gao et al. (2024) \autocite{gao2024retrievalaugmented}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Information Density:} A larger context window allows for more retrieved chunks to be passed to the LLM, potentially increasing the comprehensiveness of the answer. However, this also increases the risk of the "lost in the middle" problem, where the model may overlook relevant information buried in a long context \autocite{liu2023lost}.
    \item \textbf{Cost and Latency:} Processing larger contexts is more computationally expensive, leading to higher operational costs and slower response times.
    \item \textbf{Architectural Differences:} Newer models with very large context windows (e.g., Claude 3) are designed to be more effective at finding and using information within long documents, which can be a significant advantage for certain RAG applications.
\end{itemize}

\section{Trade-offs in LLM Selection}
Choosing the right LLM for a RAG system involves balancing several factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance:} The quality of the generated output, measured by metrics like faithfulness, relevancy, and accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} The financial cost per generated token, which can vary significantly between models.
    \item \textbf{Speed (Latency):} The time it takes for the model to generate a response.
    \item \textbf{Customizability:} The ability to fine-tune the model on domain-specific data, which is often easier with open-source models.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, the optimal choice depends on the specific requirements of the application. A customer-facing chatbot might prioritize speed and low cost, while a legal research assistant would prioritize the highest possible accuracy and faithfulness, even at a greater computational expense.
