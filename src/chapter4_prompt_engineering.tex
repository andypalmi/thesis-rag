\chapter{Prompt Engineering for RAG}
\label{chap:prompt_engineering}

In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system, the prompt serves as the crucial interface between the retrieved information and the generative capabilities of the Large Language Model. Effective prompt engineering is indispensable for guiding the LLM in synthesizing the provided context and generating an accurate, relevant, and coherently structured response. This chapter explores the fundamental principles of prompt design for RAG, different prompting styles, and the methodologies for evaluating their effectiveness.

\section{Concepts of Prompt Engineering}
A RAG prompt exhibits greater complexity compared to a standard query directed at an LLM. It must effectively integrate two distinct informational components: the user's original query and the retrieved context. The structure of the prompt governs the LLM's interpretation and utilization of the provided information.

A typical RAG prompt includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instructions:} Explicit directives to the LLM regarding its operational behavior. This may encompass instructions to exclusively utilize the provided context, to assume a particular persona, or to format the output in a specified manner.
    \item \textbf{Context:} The set of retrieved document chunks that are relevant to the query.
    \item \textbf{Query:} The user's original question or request.
\end{itemize}

The formulation of the prompt necessitates a meticulous arrangement of these elements. For instance, a typical template might be structured as follows:

\texttt{You are a helpful assistant. Use the following context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.}

\texttt{Context: [retrieved chunks]}

\texttt{Question: [user query]}

\section{Prompt Styles}
Diverse prompting styles can be employed contingent upon the specific task and the LLM in use. The selection of style can substantially influence the quality of the generated response.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zero-Shot Prompting:} This represents the most prevalent style in RAG, wherein the LLM receives instructions and context without prior examples demonstrating task completion. The efficacy of zero-shot prompts is highly dependent on the clarity of the instructions and the LLM's intrinsic capacity for reasoning and adherence to directives.
    
    \item \textbf{Few-Shot Prompting:} In this approach, the prompt incorporates a limited number of examples (shots) illustrating the desired input-output format. This can prove particularly advantageous for intricate tasks or when a highly specific output structure is mandated. For RAG, this might entail demonstrating to the model how to synthesize context into an answer for a few sample questions prior to presenting the actual query.
    
    \item \textbf{Instruction-Based Prompts:} These prompts emphasize the provision of highly detailed and explicit instructions. This may encompass negative constraints (e.g., "Do not mention information not present in the context") and positive constraints (e.g., "Summarize the answer in three bullet points").
    
    \item \textbf{Role-Playing Prompts:} Assigning a specific role to the LLM (e.g., "You are a financial analyst reviewing these documents") can assist in framing the context and directing the tone and focus of the response.
\end{itemize}

\section{Prompt Evaluation}
Evaluating the efficacy of different prompts constitutes a critical step in optimizing a RAG pipeline. Given that the quality of a generated response can be subjective, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods is frequently employed.

\subsection{Golden Datasets}
A \textbf{golden dataset} comprises a curated collection of queries coupled with optimal, human-verified answers. By comparing the LLM's output for a given query against the golden answer, one can evaluate the quality of the prompt. While the creation of a golden dataset can be labor-intensive, it furnishes a robust benchmark for evaluation.

\subsection{LLM-as-a-Judge}
A more scalable approach to evaluation involves employing another, often more powerful, LLM as an evaluator, a methodology demonstrated to correlate favorably with human judgment \autocite{zheng2023judging}. This methodology is termed the \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge} method. Frameworks such as \textbf{DeepEval} have materialized to standardize this process. An evaluator LLM is provided with a set of criteria and tasked with assessing the output of the RAG system across various dimensions.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
When employing an LLM-as-a-Judge, several pivotal metrics are utilized to evaluate the quality of the RAG output. These metrics offer a multi-faceted perspective on performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{G-Eval / DAG (Detail, Accuracy, Groundedness):} A composite score wherein the evaluator LLM assesses the response based on its level of detail, factual accuracy, and the extent to which it is grounded in the provided context.
    \item \textbf{Answer Relevancy:} Quantifies the degree to which the generated answer addresses the user's original query. A factually correct answer lacks utility if it fails to address the posed question.
    \item \textbf{Faithfulness:} This metric evaluates whether the LLM's response constitutes a faithful representation of the information contained within the retrieved context. A high faithfulness score indicates that the model did not fabricate information not present in the source documents.
    \item \textbf{Hallucination Rate:} Specifically quantifies the incidence of factually incorrect or nonsensical statements within the output. This constitutes a critical metric for constructing trustworthy RAG systems.
\end{itemize}

By systematically testing different prompt structures and styles and evaluating them against these metrics, it becomes feasible to identify the optimal prompt design that maximizes the performance of the RAG system for a given application.
